# Kactor

## Introduction

Kactor is a lightweight actor model implementation in Rust, designed to facilitate the development of concurrent and distributed applications. It provides a robust framework for building applications using the actor model, allowing for easy management of state, concurrency, and communication between actors.

## Architecture Design

KActor is built around the actor model, where each actor is an independent unit of computation that encapsulates state and behavior. The architecture is designed to support distributed systems, allowing actors to communicate seamlessly across different nodes. The key components of the architecture include:

- **Actors**: The fundamental building blocks that process messages asynchronously. Each actor has its own state and can only communicate with other actors through message passing.
- **ActorRef**: A reference to an actor that can be used to send messages. It abstracts the details of the actor's location, allowing for easy communication in a distributed environment.
- **Context**: Provides information about the actor's environment and methods to interact with the system. It includes features for managing lifecycle events and accessing other actors.
- **Supervision**: A strategy for managing actor failures and restarts. Supervisors can monitor child actors and decide how to handle failures, ensuring system resilience.
- **Middleware**: Components that can intercept messages for logging, metrics, or other purposes. Middleware can be used to implement cross-cutting concerns like authentication and monitoring.
- **Dispatchers**: Responsible for scheduling and executing actor tasks. Dispatchers can be configured to optimize performance based on the workload and system resources.

### AI Agent Support

KActor supports the development of AI agents based on the actor model. These agents can leverage the distributed nature of the architecture to perform complex tasks, such as:

- **Intelligent Decision Making**: AI agents can analyze data and make decisions based on predefined rules or machine learning models.
- **Self-Learning**: Agents can adapt their behavior over time by learning from their interactions and experiences.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple AI agents can work together to solve problems, share information, and coordinate actions.

### Specific Applications

KActor can be used in various applications, including:

- **Real-time Data Processing**: Build systems that require real-time data processing and event handling.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Implement microservices using the actor model for better scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Game Development**: Manage game entities and their interactions using actors for a more organized architecture.
- **Distributed Systems**: Create distributed applications that require coordination and communication between multiple actors.
- **AI-Driven Applications**: Develop applications that utilize AI agents for tasks such as recommendation systems, automated trading, and intelligent chatbots.

### Key Components

- **Cluster Management**: Handles actor membership, gossip protocols, and event handling within a cluster.
- **Message Handling**: Supports various message types and ensures reliable delivery.
- **Supervision Strategies**: Implements different strategies for managing actor lifecycles and failures.

## Roadmap

- **Q1 2025**: Initial release with basic actor functionality and message passing, implementing supervision strategies and middleware support, enhancing documentation and examples for better usability.
- **Q2 2025**: Add support for Actor AI Agents, allowing actors to make intelligent decisions and self-learn.
  
## Usage

To use KActor in your Rust project, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Include KActor in your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   kactor = "0.1"  # Replace with the latest version
   ```

2. **Create an Actor**: Define your actor by implementing the `Actor` trait:

   ```rust
   use kactor::actor::{Actor, ActorRef};
   use kactor::context::Context;
   use kactor::message::Message;

   struct MyActor;

   #[async_trait::async_trait]
   impl Actor for MyActor {
       async fn receive(&mut self, ctx: &Context, msg: Message) -> Result<(), SendError> {
           // Handle the message
           Ok(())
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Spawn the Actor**: Use the `Props` struct to create and manage your actor:

   ```rust
   use kactor::props::Props;

   let props = Props::new(|| Box::new(MyActor));
   let actor_ref = props.spawn(None).unwrap();
   ```

4. **Send Messages**: Use the `ActorRef` to send messages to your actor:

   ```rust
   actor_ref.send(Message::new("Hello, Actor!")).await.unwrap();
   ```

## FAQ

### How do I handle errors in my actor?

You can handle errors by returning a `Result` type from your `receive` method. Make sure to log or manage errors appropriately.

### Can I use Kactor for microservices?

Yes, Kactor is designed to support microservices architecture, allowing for better scalability and fault tolerance.

## Example Applications

Here are some example applications that demonstrate the capabilities of Kactor:

- **Chat Application**: A simple chat application where each user is represented as an actor. Messages are sent between actors to facilitate real-time communication.
- **Task Scheduler**: An application that schedules tasks using actors, allowing for distributed execution and management of tasks across multiple nodes.
- **Game Server**: A game server that manages game entities as actors, enabling smooth interactions and state management in a multiplayer environment.

## API Documentation

Kactor provides a rich set of APIs for building actor-based applications. Here are some key components:

- **Actor Trait**: The core trait that all actors must implement. It defines the `receive` method for handling incoming messages.
- **ActorRef**: A reference to an actor that allows sending messages to it.
- **Props**: A configuration object used to create and manage actors.

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [API Documentation](./docs/api.md).

## Performance Optimization Tips

To optimize the performance of your Kactor applications, consider the following tips:

- **Use Dispatchers Wisely**: Configure dispatchers based on your workload to ensure efficient task scheduling.
- **Minimize Message Size**: Keep messages small to reduce serialization overhead and improve communication speed.
- **Leverage Middleware**: Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns like logging and metrics to avoid cluttering your actor logic.
